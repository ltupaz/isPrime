# Prime

A simple C++ application to check if numbers are prime and temporarily store calculation results in memory. This allows for quick, repeated checks without recalculating.

## Features

- Check if a single number is prime.
- Check for primes within a given range (input via terminal).
- Store calculation results as hexadecimal values in memory for temporary use.
- Read and process partial results from files.

## TODO

- Add command-line options for range and single number input.
- Implement in-memory storage for temporary results.
- Support storing values as hex.
- Enable reading partial results from files.
- Improve documentation and usage examples.

## Usage

Instructions coming soon.
